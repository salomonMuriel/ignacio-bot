# Frontend Development TODO List - Next.js 15 + React 19.1

## Project Overview
Building a modern Next.js 15 frontend with React 19.1 that integrates with the existing FastAPI backend. Focus on client-side React features with proper backend integration.

## TODO Tasks

### 1. Project Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize Next.js 15 project with React 19.1 using create-next-app
- [x] Configure project with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
- [x] Set up project structure with app directory and component folders

### 2. Type Safety & API Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create TypeScript types based on backend Pydantic models
- [x] Build API client for FastAPI backend with React 19.1 use() API for promise handling

### 3. Core Layout & Landing
- [x] Create root layout with Next.js 15 metadata API and Spanish language support
- [x] Build Colombian Spanish landing page as Server Component with hero section and CTAs

### 4. State Management ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement React Context with React 19.1 use() API for global state management
  - [x] AuthContext for user authentication state
  - [x] ProjectContext for multi-project management with active project switching
  - [x] ConversationContext for chat conversations and messages with optimistic updates
  - [x] GlobalProviders component integrating all contexts into app layout
  - [x] React 19.1 compatible hook patterns with upgrade path to use(), useOptimistic, useActionState
  - [x] Type-safe context interfaces with full TypeScript integration
  - [x] Local storage persistence for active project and conversation state

### 5. Chat Interface
- [ ] Build chat layout with sidebar and project switcher using Server/Client Components
- [ ] Implement conversation list with SWR and React 19.1 promise handling
- [ ] Create message display component with optimistic updates using useOptimistic
- [ ] Build message input form with useActionState for client-side form handling
- [ ] Implement file upload functionality calling FastAPI /files endpoints
- [ ] Add conversation title editing calling PUT /api/chat/conversations/{id}

### 6. Project Management
- [ ] Create project onboarding modal for users with no projects
- [ ] Build project management page with CRUD operations calling FastAPI endpoints
- [ ] Implement project creation form with useActionState calling POST /project/
- [ ] Create project editing interface with dynamic routing [id] calling PUT /project/{id}
- [ ] Implement project context editor calling FastAPI project context endpoints
- [ ] Create project placeholder logo system with colorful SVG avatars

### 7. Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate with backend test user (a456f25a-6269-4de3-87df-48b0a3389d01)
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states for all FastAPI calls
- [ ] Add responsive design with Tailwind CSS for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Test all functionality end-to-end with FastAPI backend integration

### 8. Optimization
- [ ] Optimize performance using Next.js 15 and React 19.1 client-side features

## Key Technical Decisions

### React 19.1 Features Used
- **`use()` API** - Promise factory functions ready for use() integration in components
- **Optimistic Updates** - useState-based patterns with upgrade path to useOptimistic
- **Form State Management** - Compatible structure ready for useActionState migration
- **Context API** - Advanced state management with conditional context reading

### Next.js 15 Features Used
- **App Router** - File-system based routing
- **Server/Client Components** - Hybrid architecture
- **Metadata API** - SEO optimization
- **Dynamic Routing** - [id] parameters for projects

### FastAPI Integration
- All data operations call existing backend endpoints
- No Server Actions - clean client-server separation
- Type-safe API client matching backend Pydantic models
- Test user: `a456f25a-6269-4de3-87df-48b0a3389d01`

## Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 handles UI and user experience
- **Backend**: FastAPI handles business logic, database, AI processing
- **Communication**: RESTful API calls to `http://localhost:8000`
- **Language**: Spanish content initially, ready for i18n
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **State**: React Context (Auth, Projects, Conversations) + promise-based data fetching
