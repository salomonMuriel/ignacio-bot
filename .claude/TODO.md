# React 19.1 Frontend Rewrite - Current TODO Status

##  COMPLETED: Phase 2 - Core Architecture & State Management (2025-09-14)

###  Complete Frontend Architecture
- [x] **Vite + React 19.1** setup with TypeScript and hot reload
- [x] **API Service Layer** - Complete HTTP client with mocked authentication
- [x] **React Context State Management** - Auth, Projects, Conversations, Global
- [x] **Modern React 19.1 Patterns** - useActionState, useOptimistic, useAsync
- [x] **Optimistic Updates System** - Comprehensive UX improvements
- [x] **TypeScript Integration** - Full type safety matching backend Pydantic models
- [x] **Development Environment** - Vite dev server running on localhost:3000
- [x] **Code Quality** - ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript strict mode

###  Context Providers Implemented
- [x] **AuthContext** - Authentication state with mock user system
- [x] **ProjectsContext** - Multi-project management with active project tracking
- [x] **ConversationsContext** - Chat state with real-time messaging support  
- [x] **GlobalContext** - App-wide settings, notifications, theme management

###  API Integration Complete
- [x] **Project APIs** - CRUD operations, context management, conversation listing
- [x] **Chat APIs** - Unified message endpoint, conversation management
- [x] **Mock Authentication** - Test user integration ready for Phase 4 OTP
- [x] **File Upload Support** - FormData handling for attachments
- [x] **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and recovery

## =§ NEXT: Phase 2.5 - Frontend UI Components Implementation

### =Ë Landing Page & Navigation
- [ ] Create hero section introducing Ignacio Bot and Action Lab
- [ ] Set up React Router for client-side routing
- [ ] Build navigation components (header, sidebar, breadcrumbs)
- [ ] Implement project guards to ensure users have projects
- [ ] Create responsive layout with mobile-first design

### =Ë Project Management UI
- [ ] Build project creation flow with modal for first-time users
- [ ] Create project dashboard for multi-project management
- [ ] Implement project form components (create/edit)
- [ ] Build project selector for switching active projects
- [ ] Add project context display to show current project info

### =Ë Chat Interface Components
- [ ] Create main chat layout with sidebar
- [ ] Build conversation list sidebar with history
- [ ] Implement message components (user/AI bubbles)
- [ ] Create message input with file upload support
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file upload interface
- [ ] Implement typing indicators and real-time status
- [ ] Build welcome view for first-time chat experience

### =Ë Global UI Components
- [ ] Implement notification system using react-hot-toast
- [ ] Create loading states with skeleton screens
- [ ] Add error boundaries and error recovery
- [ ] Build theme system with light/dark mode toggle
- [ ] Ensure accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## <¯ Success Criteria for Phase 2.5
- [ ] Complete functional UI matching original specifications
- [ ] Project-first workflow operational (users must create project first)
- [ ] Chat interface with real-time messaging and file uploads
- [ ] Responsive design working on mobile and desktop
- [ ] All React 19.1 patterns properly implemented in UI
- [ ] Optimistic updates visible and working in chat interface

## = Implementation Notes
- **Frontend Ready**: All state management and API integration complete
- **Backend Ready**: All endpoints tested and operational
- **Mock Auth**: Using test user ID from backend for development
- **Project-First**: Enforce project creation before chat access
- **Modern React**: Leverage all React 19.1 patterns in UI components
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript throughout UI components

## =Ý Technical Debt
- Fix remaining ESLint warnings (mostly unused imports and React refresh)
- Consider implementing missing UI components that backend expects
- Plan for Phase 4 authentication integration (OTP system)
- Document component patterns for consistent implementation

## =€ Ready to Start
**All architecture is complete. UI implementation can begin immediately.**
**Vite development server running on http://localhost:3000**
