# Current Status - Phase 3: File Upload & Management

## ✅ Phase 3: COMPLETED Tasks
- [x] **Backend File System** - Supabase Storage with user-specific folders
- [x] **File Upload Service** - 10MB limit, audio/documents/images validation
- [x] **File Metadata Management** - Database models and CRUD operations
- [x] **Secure File Operations** - Download/serving with user permission checks
- [x] **File API Endpoints** - Complete REST API (upload, download, metadata, delete)
- [x] **Frontend File Components** - Drag-and-drop upload, preview, management
- [x] **Chat Integration** - File attachment capability in message input
- [x] **File Management UI** - Browse, search, filter, and manage user files
- [x] **Security & Validation** - Comprehensive file type and size restrictions

## ⚠️ REMAINING TASKS - AI Integration
**These 2 critical tasks are still missing for complete Phase 3:**

### **MISSING Task 1: Document Content Extraction**
- [ ] **Extract text content** from uploaded documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
- [ ] **Store extracted content** in database for AI access
- [ ] **Handle various document formats** with appropriate libraries
- [ ] **Error handling** for corrupted or unsupported document formats

### **MISSING Task 2: AI Context Integration**
- [ ] **Make file content available** to PydanticAI context
- [ ] **Integrate document search** into AI response generation
- [ ] **Create document-aware responses** that reference uploaded content
- [ ] **Update AI prompts** to utilize document context effectively

## Current System Status
- ✅ Backend running on port 8000 (FastAPI with file upload APIs)
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3000 (React with file upload UI)
- ✅ Phase 2 completed (96 tests passing)
- ✅ File upload system fully functional with 10MB/type restrictions
- ⚠️ **AI cannot yet read or reference uploaded documents**

## File System Features Working
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface in chat with validation
- **File Storage**: User-specific folders (`/users/{user_id}/files/`)
- **File Types**: Audio (mp3, wav, m4a, ogg, flac), Documents (pdf, txt, doc, docx), Images (jpg, png, gif, webp)
- **File Management**: Browse, preview, download, delete files
- **Security**: Access control, user isolation, comprehensive validation

## Implementation Details Completed
### Backend (`backend/app/`)
- `services/storage.py` - File upload/download service with validation
- `routers/files.py` - Complete REST API for file operations
- `models/database.py` - UserFile model with metadata
- File validation: 10MB limit, specific file types only

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)
- `services/fileService.ts` - File upload client with validation
- `components/files/FileUpload.tsx` - Drag-and-drop upload component
- `components/files/FilePreview.tsx` - File preview with actions
- `components/files/FileManager.tsx` - Complete file management interface
- `components/chat/MessageInput.tsx` - Chat integration with file attachments

## Next Steps
To complete Phase 3, implement the 2 missing AI integration tasks above, then proceed to Phase 4 (Authentication System).
