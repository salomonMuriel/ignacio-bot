# Ignacio Bot - Current Status

**Date**: September 7, 2025
**Last Updated**: Phase 3 OpenAI Integration Implementation

## System Status
- ✅ **Backend API**: Running on `http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ **Frontend App**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **Database**: Supabase connected and operational
- ✅ **File Storage**: Supabase Storage integrated
- ⚠️ **AI Service**: Functional but needs migration to Agent SDK

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- Database schema with users, conversations, messages, user_files tables
- Supabase integration for database and file storage
- FastAPI backend with proper routing and middleware
- React TypeScript frontend with basic UI

### File Management ✅
- File upload functionality (documents, images, audio)
- File validation (10MB limit, type restrictions)
- Supabase Storage integration with user-specific folders
- File metadata tracking in database
- OpenAI file service for document processing pipeline

### Chat System ✅
- Basic conversation functionality
- Message storage and retrieval
- User context management
- Frontend chat interface with file upload

### Database ✅
- All migrations applied (001-004)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- User management foundation
- Temporary user created for testing (UUID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

## Current Issues & Blockers

### AI Integration ⚠️
**Problem**: OpenAI Responses API implementation is incorrect
- `client.responses.create()` doesn't exist in OpenAI Python client
- Current workaround uses basic chat completions without tools
- Document search and web search tools not functional

**Solution**: Migrate to OpenAI Agent SDK
- Provides proper tool integration (file_search, web_search)
- Better conversation state management
- Cleaner API for assistant-style interactions

### Missing Features
- User authentication system (OTP via WhatsApp)
- Admin panel for user management
- WhatsApp integration
- Proper document context in AI responses
- Web search capabilities

## Next Development Phase

### Priority 1: AI System Migration
Replace `app/services/ai_service_responses.py` with OpenAI Agent SDK implementation:
1. Install OpenAI Agent SDK
2. Create agent with file_search and web_search tools
3. Integrate with existing file upload pipeline
4. Test document context in conversations

### Priority 2: Authentication System
- OTP generation and validation
- Session management
- Login/logout endpoints
- Frontend auth integration

### Priority 3: Enhanced Features
- Admin user management interface
- WhatsApp webhook integration
- Improved chat UI with file previews
- Conversation history management

## Technical Notes

### File Upload Flow
1. Frontend validates file (size, type)
2. Uploads to Supabase Storage via backend API
3. Creates database record in `user_files` table
4. Background task syncs file to OpenAI (when working)
5. File available for AI context (pending Agent SDK migration)

### Database Schema
- `users`: Basic user info with phone numbers
- `conversations`: Chat sessions per user
- `messages`: Individual chat messages with file references
- `user_files`: File metadata with OpenAI sync status
- `user_sessions`: Authentication sessions (ready for implementation)
- `otp_codes`: OTP verification codes (ready for implementation)

### Environment Configuration
- All required environment variables configured in `backend/.env.local`
- Supabase URL and keys working
- OpenAI API key configured
- CORS and security middleware properly set up

## Testing Status
- 96 comprehensive backend tests passing
- File upload/download functionality verified
- Database operations tested
- API endpoints functional
- Frontend integration working (basic chat + file upload)

**Ready for**: OpenAI Agent SDK migration to complete Phase 3 AI integration
**Blocked on**: Proper AI tool implementation (file_search, web_search)
**Next milestone**: Full document-aware AI conversations with web search capabilities
